## Practical 5
**Aim: Design, develop and implement a program in C to implement doubly linked list where each node consists of integers.  
The program should support following functions:  
a) Create a doubly linked list  
b) Insert a new node   
c) Delete a node if it is found, otherwise display appropriate message   
d) Display the nodes of doubly linked list**
